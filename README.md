# Magnificent-Materials

As a disclaimer, this mod's code doesn't do anything spectacular — it is intentionally simple, friendly, and modular. It utilizes baseline, proven code (within the infrastructure of Minecraft and Forge) to add a bunch of useful content to Minecraft for use in other, further mods — centering around the addition of new materials. Each material implemented by the mod is given standard features such as armor, tools, and the expected crafting recipes. Honestly, I started it as a way to practice Java and modding.

Eventually, it will be possible to disable any of the materials in the mod's config file. Also, it may handle ore generation.
