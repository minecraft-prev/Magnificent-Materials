# Magnificent-Materials

Currently, this mod adds the "Mithril" metal to Minecraft 1.19.2 â€” complete with the expected features, including a unique, 3D-modeled armor set and even horse armor. As of June 14, 2024, I am currently porting the mod to 1.20.1 for expansion where it will additionally backport the Tuff blocks from 1.21 with some higher explosion resistance, expanding on Tuff as a building material for the 1.20.1 editions.

[UPDATE] Added the missing recipes for the set of tools; mod was believed to be finished (wow I'm stupid).
