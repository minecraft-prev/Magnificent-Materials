# Magnificent-Materials

As a disclaimer, this mod's code doesn't do anything spectacular — it is intentionally simple, friendly, and modular. It utilizes baseline, proven code (within the infrastructure of Minecraft and Forge) and the GeckoLib infrastructure to add a bunch of useful, hopefully quality content to Minecraft for use in other, further mods — centering around the addition of new materials. Each material added by the mod is given standard features such as armor, tools, and the expected crafting recipes. Honestly, this project began as a way to practice Java, modding, which I have enjoyed for years, and pixel art.

Eventually, you may disable any of the materials in the mod's config file. Also, it may handle wider ore generation.
